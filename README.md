# Orba

This is my collection of personal presets for the Artiphon Orba: https://artiphon.com/pages/orba-by-artiphon

The presets are made using their Orbasynth product, which can be downloaded here: https://artiphon.com/pages/downloads

They can be loaded onto your Orba using the Orba app on desktop.

They are categorized by type via directories.
